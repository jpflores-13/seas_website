  title: "OUR STORY"
  description : "Students for Equity in and Advocacy in STEM (SEAS) was created by a cohort of Biochemistry, Biology, and Chemistry majors during the Summer of 2020. Upon the national call to critically evaluate and reimagine the operations of existing systems, from policing to academia, these students gathered virtually to discuss tangible actions that can be taken to make the Biology and Chemistry Departments at Occidental College more equitable and just spaces for underrepresented groups in science. 


Although initially a group focused on science, SEAS has grown to include members from other STEM departments and underwent a rebranding from Students for Equity in Science (SES) to Students for Equity and Advocacy in STEM (SEAS) in November of 2020. Nevertheless, recognizing the manner in which STEM fields collectively continue to exclude members from marginalized communities and the numerous ways in which they uphold white supremacy, this cohort of students came together to advocate for intentional community-building for students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.

 # description : "This summer, several Occidental Biology, Biochemistry, and Chemistry students came together to discuss ways in which their respective academic departments can implement meaningful changes to empower and create a sense of belonging for students who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), as well as students holding other historically underrepresented identities in STEM. This cohort of students, now formally known as the Students for Equity in STEM, gathered both in response to the national call to critically evaluate and reimagine the unjust and inequitable operations of existing systems, such as policing or academia, and with the understanding that all STEM fields have been and remain exclusionary to marginalized communities across the nation. Thus, acknowledging the numerous ways in which these fields continue to uphold white supremacy, this cohort came together to advocate for intentional community-building for Oxy students who embrace marginalized identities in science."
  #title : "OUR PURPOSE"
  #description : "The objective of SEAS is to support and empower students from marginalized or historically underrepresented* groups in science. We believe that recognizing differences and fully embracing our collective diversity is key to our community’s excellence." 
 # Our shared vision therefore integrates the following:
 # content : "Foster an intentional and accessible space for students from varied backgrounds and abilities to build community and find a sense of belonging within STEM. "
 # content : "Advocate for the needs of marginalized students and for the integration of a social justice lens in  scientific curriculum at Occidental College." 
 # content : "Collaborate with faculty, alumni, students, and community members to elevate accessibility to resources and opportunities that will support marginalized students’ educational, professional, and personal goals in STEM."

      designation : ""
      content : "Mudaser Basam graduated from Oxy in December of 2018 with his Bachelors of Arts (Honors) in biology. As an undergraduate, he joined Dr. Zellmer's lab to research the distribution of slender salamanders across the urbanized environment of Los Angeles and explored his interests in computational biology. His first post-graduate job was at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center as a research associate studying the correlation between aging and breast cancer risk via in-silico research. Currently, he is a first-year medical student at the California University of Science and Medicine in San Bernardino, California. 
      
      

Mudaser's motivation to become a physician comes from stories he heard about his open-heart surgery at 18 months old to repair a congenital defect. His mother recalls the profound impact the surgeon's kindness and compassion had on her, both before the surgery when he explained the procedure and after carrying the stroller to the car. As a Middle Eastern woman who was not proficient in English, felt discriminated against because of her hijab, and relied on state-sponsored programs like Medicaid and WIC to support the family, compassion from a stranger was something out of the ordinary. He hopes to show that level of compassion to other underserved communities through his medical practice. Currently, he enjoys landscape photography, hikes along the Santa Monica mountains, exploring new restaurants, and misses playing volleyball.
