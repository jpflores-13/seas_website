### [Panelist Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAnvMCEGuwY0fuRs50yfOnKmkRybk6blPE-ewK94NLI4OxRA/viewform)

Our first CATALYST event will be a panel discussion on “Burnout, Imposter Syndrome, and Finding a Sense of Belonging in STEM”. Underrepresented minorities in STEM are often faced with these unique challenges, and we would like to use the event to validate these experiences and provide students with guidance on how to overcome these barriers in STEM fields. The panel will take place in mid-February, although the specific date and time are to be determined. **If you are an Oxy alumnus and are interested in becoming a panelist, please let us know by filling out this short form. A small honorarium will be provided for your labor. We will be in touch with more details shortly!**

This form will help us to better understand the needs of students and what events you'd like to see from us! We look forward to hearing your thoughts.
