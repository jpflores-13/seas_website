## PROMISE: PROGRAM FOR UNDERREPRESENTED INCOMING STEM-INTERESTED STUDENTS 
*In partnership with Students for Equity and Advocacy in STEM*

## Background
During the Fall 2020 semester and in partnership with Professor of Biology at Occidental College John McCormack, a cohort of Oxy students from Students for Equity and Advocacy in STEM began drafting the creation of PROMISE: a five-week summer immersive and residential program intended to engage incoming junior and senior high school students from Los Angeles in STEM. 

## Mission
To increase engagement in and raise accessibility to STEM education and opportunities for historically underrepresented high school students in STEM.  

## Objectives
- Immerse students from underrepresented backgrounds in a variety of STEM fields and opportunities, including research, education, community and civic engagement, and advocacy. 
- Utilize an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the multifaceted nature of STEM and empower students to pursue their educational goals. 
- Foster a diverse and inclusive community in STEM and equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed and thrive in STEM.
- Curate supportive systems for students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM by providing mentorship opportunities and collaborating with a variety of campus offices and departments.
- Create mutually beneficial partnerships (as outlined in the [Principles for Occidental College-Community Neighborhood Development](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19dm0bymMnUMSljUC3VJuNlBVIp2NEcYl/view)) between Occidental College and surrounding high schools in the Los Angeles community, with an emphasis on Northeast LA. 

## Eligibility
The first cohort of PROMISE will be composed of 20 incoming high school juniors or seniors enrolled in Los Angeles County high schools. Prospective applicants must be currently enrolled incoming juniors or seniors in Los Angeles County, preferably in Northeast LA. No GPA requirement or prior experience in STEM is necessary to apply. There is an application fee (do we want one?) of $15.00 (random). This fee can be waived by getting in contact with x@oxy.edu. 

## Why students from Northeast Los Angeles (NELA)? 

Occidental College is positioned in a vibrant and diverse community. PROMISE offers an opportunity for Oxy to create new partnerships with local high schools in Los Angeles and to connect with the community through new means. PROMISE will fulfill Oxy’s four cornerstones: excellence, equity, community, and service by providing an avenue for local high school students from underrepresented backgrounds to explore the fields of STEM in a novel and innovative way. Our goal is to not only uplift these students to pursue their educational goals through higher education, but to help diversify science, technology, engineering, and mathematics–fields that historically have failed to be inclusive spaces for marginalized communities. PROMISE centers giving back to the LA community and building mutually beneficial relationships with community partners; working collaboratively with our neighbors to encourage and build a more diverse–and therefore stronger–future STEM workforce.

According to recently released data by the California Department of Education (CDE), 148 of the 781 lowest performing schools in California are in Los Angeles County. Of the top 10 lowest performing schools, five are in Los Angeles County: Eastside High (Antelope Valley), Antelope Valley High (Antelope Valley), City of Angels (Los Angeles), Littlerock High (Antelope Valley), and Manual Arts Senior High (Los Angeles). According to this data, L.A. Unified (LAUSD) has 110 schools that require assistance, with 56 of these schools being in the bottom 5 percent of schools in LAUSD. Furthermore, according to the U.S. News, there are no ranked public schools in LAUSD for STEM education. 
Results from the 2018-2019 California Science Test (CAST), administered to students in Grades 5 and 8, and in Grades 10, 11 or 12, demonstrate wide disparities among students from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds in STEM. Notably, these results show that “across all grades statewide, 9.94 percent of disadvantaged black students and 15.64 percent of disadvantaged Latino students met or exceeded the science standards on...CAST, compared to 44 percent of non-disadvantaged white students and nearly 60 percent of Asian students.”4 Statewide results for CAST are compared below with those from LAUSD. More detailed results are available on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [website](https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/ViewReportCAST?ps=true&lstTestYear=2019&lstTestType=X&lstGroup=1&lstSchoolType=A&lstGrade=10&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000&lstFocus=btnApplySelections).

As an undergraduate institution with a multitude of STEM departments; all dedicated to [supporting](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/student-success/cosmos/about) students from diverse backgrounds, we feel that Oxy has the capacity and passion to support marginalized high school students in the community who are interested in pursuing STEM. Being an institution that has benefited immensely from the dynamic culture and richness of the city of LA; a community built by hardworking people of color, we believe that Oxy has a moral obligation to give back to the community.

## Outreach to Community 
Connecting with the LA community will take multiple forms. We plan to engage and gain community input at all stages of the planning and execution process for PROMISE. This will ensure that PROMISE is a truly collaborative effort molded by both Oxy and community members. This form of engagement also ensures that PROMISE serves the community in the way that the community would like to be served. To spread the word about PROMISE, we will contact Los Angeles County high school principals and teachers. Once PROMISE is established, we will send flyers, emails, and contact high school/college counselors about holding short information sessions.

## Program Components 
### Academic Component 

The academic component of PROMISE will take place for an hour Monday through Friday. This portion will combine an introduction to a variety of STEM fields as well as introduce the range of impacts of science.  This course will encourage students to analyze how external factors such as politics influence scientific decisions as well as how science shapes society. 

The course will be discussion based with assigned readings three days a week. The other two days will introduce careers.

Example topics:
- Medical community’s abuse of marginalized communities (Tuskegee Syphilis Study) 
- Palm Oil 
- Bisphenol A 
- Particulate matter 
- Eugenics 
- CRISPR (watch Human Nature)
- Algorithms
- Artificial intelligence
- Science Policy
- Science Communication
- Epidemiology
- Patent Law
- Staticians
- Electricians
- Web Page Design
- Agriculture

### Lab Component (in conjunction with the URC Summer Research Program) (TR 1:30pm-4:25pm)
- Lab rotations into each participating research lab 
- Hear elevator pitch of lab
- Do low-stakes experiment in lab 
- Meet lab personnel 
- Bootcamp/workshop introducing other scientific skills (science policy, SciComm, etc.)
- Bootcamp/workshop teaching students how to write a CV, resume, use Excel, R,  etc.

### Mentorship Component
- URC Summer Research Students can participate in being a mentor for PROMISE students by indicating so in their initial applications for SRP 
- Must have research mentor approval
- $200 bonus (?)
- mentor/mentee lunch during weekly SRP luncheon

## Student Workshops 
### Resume/CV Workshop
- The resume is one of the most valuable tools in your job search toolkit. A resume not only provides an overview of your past experience. It also markets your skills and, most importantly, accomplishments to a potential employer.
- A strong, well-written cover letter acts as your first impression and is a vital supplement to a solid resume. Stand out amongst other job and internship applicants by clearly and concisely linking your experience and skills with the employer’s needs.
### Interview Workshop
- The interview is the intermediate stage in the job hiring process. You perfect the resume/CV for this moment. Learning how to interview professionally will give PROMISE students important life-long skills pertinent for the job and internship search. 
### Microsoft Excel/ R Workshop
- Learning how to use Microsoft Excel and the programming language R are two incredibly marketable skills attractive to numerous employers and institutes of higher education. They are tools that can be leveraged to improve any individual (including the user) and company’s work flow, as well as aid in organization and data science.

### Why this structure works 
Probably should include some articles supporting why creating a program in this way is beneficial/what the benefits are of doing things this way

## Housing & Dining
The residential experience is an integral component of an immersive, summer program. Providing housing for PROMISE students ensures a place where students can come together to celebrate each other and learn to live as a community. This allows for opportunities that foster inclusive living-learning communities, provides avenues for learning life skills and abilities that prepare students for lifelong learning in a global society, and encourages the holistic development and wellness of students by intentionally challenging and supporting them. 

Our students would be housed with students participating in the Undergraduate Research Center’s Summer Research Program (SRP) which would result in a mutually beneficial environment encouraging mentorship and a culture of care. Pairing the housing experiences of PROMISE and the SRP would alleviate the work needed to be done by Summer Residential Advisors (RAs) and Occidental’s superb Facilities staff.

## Funding 
The successful implementation of PROMISE and its maintenance over many years is dependent on procuring funding from multiple stable sources. Students for Equity and Advocacy in STEM have identified the following potential funding avenues within Occidental College: the Undergraduate Research Center, the President’s Office, Trustees, Alumni and alumni affinity organizations, the Intercultural Community Center, and the Associated Students of Occidental College. We have also identified the following potential funding avenues outside of Oxy: National Science Foundation grants and other external grants (Battelle, ). Below is a breakdown of the estimated total cost of implementing PROMISE and supporting 20 high school students for the pilot program over the Summer of 2022.

|Name|Amount|Comment|Funding Avenue|
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
|High school student stipends (20) | $500 ea. ($10,000 total) | PROMISE aims to make STEM education accessible to students from low-income backgrounds. In our effort to fully make this program accessible, we want to provide a small stipend to HS students who might otherwise have to work during the program period. | External Grant |
