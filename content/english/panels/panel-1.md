Our first panel of the semester took place on Friday, February 12th and featured three amazing Oxy alumni: **Dr. Margarita Loeza ‘90, Dr. Piul Rabbani ‘06, and Ayanna Lynch ‘20!** They spoke to over 20 Oxy students about their experiences with burnout, imposter syndrome, and finding a sense of belonging in STEM, and shared their advice for overcoming these challenges.

Some common themes discussed were struggling with imposter syndrome in white male-dominated spaces. Both Ayanna and Dr. Rabbani referenced a quote by Michelle Obama that they lean on for inspiration:

> *“Here’s the secret: they’re not that smart. There are a lot of things that folks are doing to keep their seats because they don’t want to give up power. And what better way to do that than to make you feel you don’t belong . . . you have to prepare yourself, because when you get those arrows thrown at you, all you can fall back on is your experience and your ability.”*

</p>

**Here are some other great points to take away from the panel:**
- To avoid burnout, take some time everyday to do something for yourself! Whether that's reading, playing an instrument, going for a run, talking to a friend, doing yoga, or anything in between!

- You might end up in situations where you have an unsupportive academic and/or professional environment. In these situations, don't be afraid to lean on family and friends for support, even if they aren't experts in your field! Mentorship can take many forms, and you should be as intentional as possible in building your support system.

- It's okay to not know exactly where your career will take you! As long as you're doing what you love, you'll eventually find your community and work that you're passionate about.

- Don't confuse burnout with a loss of love for science! When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a step back and look at the bigger picture.


Thank you again to our amazing panelists and to everyone who attended! Be sure to keep an eye out for more events like this in the future!
