### Chemistry Liaison Community Sessions

Mondays on Zoom from 5-6 pm PST

> Meeting ID: **861 4778 1575**
> Passcode: **chemistry**

These sessions are open to students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds in STEM that are interested in the field of Chemistry! This will be a safe space to discuss classes, professors, research, professional development, and any other non-academic support students may need. *Note: this program is not intended for direct academic support (see AMP, SSAP, etc.), but instead designed to empower underrepresented students to pursue studies in Chemistry and provide them with the resources needed to do so!*
