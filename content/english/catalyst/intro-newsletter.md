### Welcome to CATALYST!
</p>

We hope you and your family are safe and healthy this holiday season. First and foremost, let’s address the elephant in the room. What is Catalyst? Formerly known as the Marginalized and Underrepresented Community Alumni Network (MUCAN), the project has recently undergone a name change and will hereafter be titled Catalyst. We understand that this may be confusing but felt it was a necessary change, as one of our wonderful alumni pointed out that our previous name seems to institutionalize the issue we aim to address. While the project has been renamed, our purpose remains the same:
 </p>

> We intend for Catalyst to create meaningful connections between currently enrolled BIPOC and underrepresented students (low-income, LGBTQIA+, etc) in STEM with alumni from similar backgrounds who either majored in the same fields, were on the pre-health and/or pre-med track at Occidental or currently work in STEM-related fields. This program is the first of its kind in our academic departments and one of the few present at our institution. 

With that said, we’d like to invite you our very first monthly Catalyst newsletter! We plan to release newsletters on a regular basis to invite y’all “back to campus” for panels and talks, announce research/internship opportunities, feature alumni and student spotlights, and provide updates on our work. On behalf of our team, welcome to our Catalyst community and we look forward to collaborating with you!


Best,

The CATALYST Team

### Our Story
</p>
This summer, several Occidental Biology, Biochemistry, and Chemistry students came together to discuss ways in which their respective academic departments can implement meaningful changes to empower and create a sense of belonging for students who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), as well as students holding other historically underrepresented identities in STEM. This cohort of students, now formally known as the Students for Equity in STEM, gathered both in response to the national call to critically evaluate and reimagine the unjust and inequitable operations of existing systems, such as policing or academia, and with the understanding that all STEM fields have been and remain exclusionary to marginalized communities across the nation. Thus, acknowledging the numerous ways in which these fields continue to uphold white supremacy, this cohort came together to advocate for intentional community-building for Oxy students who embrace marginalized identities in science.
